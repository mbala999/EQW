# Equilibrium Wall Model
Solves the equilibrium wall model ODEs using a Fortran code. This is a standalone module for the equilibrium model and can be readily plugged into any Fortran-based CFD code. The code takes the wall-parallel velocity, temperature and pressure at the exchange location as an input and gives back the corresponding wall shear stress and heat flux.
